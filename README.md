## Random Network Generator with Specified Degree Sequence 
Currently, there is not a well reconized optimal/best alogrithm to realize networks generally under all specified degree sequence.
There exist many different algorithms under several different theories and ideas.
Based on the core mathematical theories and idea, these methods can be generally classified into the following 4 family with each of its own pros and cons: Configuration model algorithms, Sequential algorithm, Switching-based algorithms and Markov chain algorithms.
There are multiple algorithms in each class optimized to fit different scenario and there are also algorithms using mixed ideas from multiple families.
So it depends on the reseacher/user to consider the trade offs of pros and cons case by case and determine which algorithm is optimal for the given 

As for now, the pacakge originaly targets on providing better interpreation of the percolation process methods in epidemiology networks and trying to extend their model applications to a wider range of problems with different assumptions. 
So we decided to start with the family of Sequential algorithms, considering its following advatages:

1.   Its interperation is simpler and relatively close to the intuitive understanding for percolation process: both assuming "asymptotical independence" and considering a degree related random paring process when generating edges.
2.   The assumptions for our epidemiology network models also fits better with its optimal condition: large sparse networks.
3.   It provides a relatively high calculation coeffiency among all families, especially for large sparse networks in general.
4.   It guaranteed that every possible graph has a postive possiblity to appear as the generation result.

However, the disadvantage of sequential algorithms is that it is harder to prove that its results is uniformly distributed among all possilbe random graphs, which is required by application and interpretion of the percolation method.
It might require extra sampling techniques on simulation results or extra conditions on original degree sequece 

In the package, we plan to provide 4 different sequential algorithms, considering the method illustration purpose and optimal performances under several possible application scenrario.
In each algorithms, provides with and Erdos-Gallai condition checking function modified to fit each algorithm.

These algorithm are temporary, we are still developing these generators while comparing their performance (and with other alorithms) under testing, to figure out if there is an optimal choice for our models, or if there is some systematical principle to choose algorithms under given condition.

### [RandomNetworkGenerator_Algorithm1.R](RandomNetworkGenerator_Algorithm1.R) : Original algorithm developed by us, inspired by Newman's algorithm. 
Its is fastest in all scenario, but has random failure, lack of rigorous analysis of distribution result.
It is used to quickly generate relatively larger size networks for testing and verification, and also to illustrate Newman's idea for comparision.

### [RandomNetworkGenerator_Algorithm2.0.R](RandomNetworkGenerator_Algorithm2.0.R) : Sequential importance algorithm with importance sampling technique, developed with some modification, based on J. Blitzstein & P. Diaconis.
Its mainly for illustration the idea of Blitzstein and Diaconis who originally develope the first squential algorithm for general degree sequences.
It come with an extra sampling procedure to adjust the simulation result to mathematically close to uniform distributed, while increasing some calculation cost.
An optimized version with several modification are provided by Algorithm 2.1

### (In Developing) [RandomNetworkGenerator_Algorithm2.1.R](RandomNetworkGenerator_Algorithm2.1.R) : Optimized version of Algorithm 2.0
With several modification on Algorithm 2.0, it proiveds better calculation efficiency than 2.0.
Currently this include the Durfee number opitmization on eachround of ECchecking and lower down the candidate list length within a single host vertex by reapply list from last round for each round of generation.
These modifications significantly increase the efficiency for large networks.
We are still trying to include the improvement inspired by Moseman in the next step, but it might require more mathematical evidence for equivalence in result.

From testing, it performs best when generating network not so "sparse"---for degree sequences with higher mean or with longer tail (like powerlaw distribtion).
The corresponding version of importance sampling technique are also in developing now.

### [RandomNetworkGenerator_Algorithm3.R](RandomNetworkGenerator_Algorithm3.R) : Mixture algorithm of 1 and 2
The algorithm is inspired by both Algorithm 1 and 2.1, which intuitively should be equivalent to Algorithm 2, but might need rigorous proof.
The idea is generate candidate list for each host vertex all at once and then check the EG condition, while guarantee success in each round of generation.
This significantly reduce the frequency of sampling and EG checking, however, leads to longer restrarting procedure if the sampling is failed.

From testing, it performs best for relatively smaller network with concentrated distribution like Mean Field and Poisson, and with higher mean degree.
The problem is the restarting time is much longer for large degree vertices at the beginning.
The sampling techinique should be similar with Algorithm 2.1.

### (In Developing, not uploaded yet) RandomNetworkGenerator_Algorithm4.R : Asymptotic Uniform Algorithm based on M. Bayati, J.H. Kim & A. Saberi
Theoritically, this algorithm seems to be the "best" in general large enough networks.
It does not require sampling techniques for the simulation results, thus guarantee asyptotically uniform, but require a relatively strict condition on network size, based on maximal degree of the sequence.
So it might still be not ideal for smaller size networks or networks with long tail degree distribution, thus other algorithm are still useful in application.

This algorithm requires better understanding on random network theories, thus we are trying to development it soon after the submission of the theoretical paper.

### (Ongoing, looking for cooperation) General Optimization of data structure and parallel computation 
The generation and epidemic simulation are built based on sparce matrix at the beginning.
While it is easiear to understand and modify, the matrix data form in R might not be a good choice to store data, considering the limitation of comupting resourses, especially RAM, so the network size is highly limited.
It might also slows down the calculation speed when loops and iterations are involved.
We are currently working on, together with collaborating data scientists and programmers, is to optimize the data structure in these algorithms to enlarge the capacity of network size for same given RAM limitation and perhaps accelate the calculation.
Another ongoing improvment will be optimize these generators and the whole package for parallel computing in multple servers and computing clusters, so simulation and verification involving large amount of simulations could be finished faster and on larger network size. 


## [EpidemicDynamicSimulator.R](EpidemicDynamicSimulator.R)
Include the epidemic dynamic simulator function GilAlgo, which is developed based on the well-known widely used Doobâ€“Gillespie algorithm (Stochastic Simulation Algorithm, SSA).
This simulator provides dynamic informations of a randomly initiated disease on a given network, represented now by a sparse matrix, with the SIR disease parameters.
Curent version is tested but might need to be optimized after the data struture optimization on network generators.

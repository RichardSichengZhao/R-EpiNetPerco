# R-EpiNetPerco
A package in R for modeling infectious diease transmission on population with social and biological heterogenity, based on SIR-compartmental complex epidemiology random networks with percolation process method and its modifications.

Developing based on the typical bond percolation method original developed by M.E.J Newman, Multiple type network percolation method by S. Bansal & L.A. Meyers, Modified network percolation process with disease dynamics by J.C. Miller, A.C. Slim & E.M.Volz, with modifications.
Also include different random network generator with specified degree sequence, based on orignal algorithms of developers, sequential importance sampling algorithm by J. Blitzstein & P. Diaconis, and asymptotic sequential algorithm by M. Bayati, J.H. Kim & A. Saberi, with modification.
The disease simulation function is developed based on Doobâ€“Gillespie algorithm (Stochastic Simulation Algorithm, SSA) 

The package is developed under R version 4.2.2

Developing, optimizing and testing in progress now! 
Looking forward to comments, issues, bug reports, using opinions and discussions from all users. 
Please contact with primary developer (Richard Zhao, Ph.D. candidate, Dept. Math & Stat, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada) by email 20sz11@queensu.ca
